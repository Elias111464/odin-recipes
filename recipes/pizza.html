    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>220g. Italian pizza dough.</li>
        <li>90g. mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>100g. crushed natural tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Salt to taste.</li>
        <li>A pinch of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Once we have the pizza dough prepared, the first thing we do is turn on 
            the oven.Full, the maximum of your oven. In my case at 250ยบ C for
            about 10 minutes and that it is hot when you insert the pizza.</li>
        <li>As the temperature must be high, it may take 10 or 15 minutes.
            It will be the recommended time we need to assemble the pizza.</li>
        <li>We put a bowl (safe for oven) with water, so that it has some moisture when
            we are going to bake it. Once we have the pizza dough prepared, already 
            spread on baking paper, we prepare the filling.</li>
    </ol>
